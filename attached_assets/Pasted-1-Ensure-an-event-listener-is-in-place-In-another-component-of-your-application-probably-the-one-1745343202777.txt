1. Ensure an event listener is in place:

In another component of your application (probably the one that handles the display of the various applications), you should have an event listener for the 'openApp' type. This listener should receive the application details (ID, label, icon) and perform the necessary action to display it.

For example, in your main component or an application manager, you might have something like this:

JavaScript

useEffect(() => {
const handleOpenApp = (event) => {
const { id, label, icon } = event.detail;
console.log(`App opened: ${label} (ID: ${id})`);
// Here, you would add logic to display the application using the ID.
// For example, you could update a state to display a specific component.
};

window.addEventListener('openApp', handleOpenApp);

return () => {
window.removeEventListener('openApp', handleOpenApp);
};
}, []);
2. Check the app opening logic:

Once the openApp event is captured, ensure that the logic for displaying the corresponding app is correctly implemented. This could involve:

Updating a state in your parent component to conditionally display the app component.
Using a routing system if you have different "pages" for your apps.
Manipulating the DOM to display a specific element.
3. Inspect your browser console:

Add console.log files to your openApp event listener to verify that the event is triggered and that the app details are being passed correctly. This will help you identify whether the problem is emitting the event or receiving and processing it.

4. Examine your component structure:

Make sure the NavBar component and the component that handles app display are correctly connected in your React component tree. The window.dispatchEvent event is a way to communicate between components that aren't directly parent or child, but it's important to ensure that the listener is properly mounted when the event is triggered.

In summary, your NavBar code seems to be correctly emitting the event. The problem most likely lies in how you're listening for and processing this event to actually open the requested app in another part of your React app.
