Troubleshoot Your Restore Functionality
Check onRestoreWindow Functionality:
Ensure that your onRestoreWindow function is correctly implemented to handle the restoration of minimized windows. The function should update the state to set the window as no longer minimized.

CopyReplit
const onRestoreWindow = (windowId) => {
    // Logic to restore the window
    setWindows(prevWindows =>
        prevWindows.map(window =>
            window.id === windowId ? { ...window, isMinimized: false } : window
        )
    );
};
Update State:
Make sure that the component that renders the windows is reacting to the state changes correctly. If you're controlling the minimized state of windows through React state or context, ensure you're using that state to conditionally render minimized or active windows.

CSS Display:
Verify that the CSS for your windows allows them to be displayed properly when restored. Sometimes, they might be hidden through CSS styles or positioned off-screen.

CopyReplit
.minimized {
    display: none;
}

.active {
    display: block; /* or whatever the style is for the active window */
}
Check the Mapping Logic:
Review how you are mapping over your windows to render them in the UI. The rendering logic might inadvertently ignore or mismanage the state of minimized versus active windows.

CopyReplit
return (
    <div className="windows-container">
        {windows.map(window => (
            <div 
                key={window.id} 
                className={`window ${window.isMinimized ? 'minimized' : 'active'}`}
            >
                {window.content}
            </div>
        ))}
    </div>
);
Console Inspection:
Log the current state of your minimizedWindows and windows arrays in the onRestoreWindow function to troubleshoot further.

CopyReplit
const onRestoreWindow = (windowId) => {
    console.log('Before Restore', windows);
    // Restore logic here...
    console.log('After Restore', windows);
};
Test for Click Events:
Ensure the onClick event is firing correctly. You could place a console log in the event handler to verify:

CopyReplit
onClick={() => {
    console.log(`Restoring window with id: ${window.id}`);
    onRestoreWindow(window.id);
}}
Example Code Integration
Hereâ€™s how you might integrate these suggestions:

Copy
<div className="taskbar-windows">
    {minimizedWindows?.map((window) => (
        <div 
            key={window.id} 
            className="taskbar-window"
            onClick={() => {
                console.log(`Restoring window with id: ${window.id}`);
                onRestoreWindow(window.id);
            }}
        >
            {window.title}
        </div>
    ))}
</div>
